    "Child Labour is a term widely used for the crime committed by employers as they employ younger children to work in factories, buildings or any other places of work. Child Labour basically refers to an illegal activity where a child is forced to work from an early age and make money. There was a child labour act made in one thousand nine hundred and eighty-six which constitutes the strict laws against the practice of child labour. This act states that “No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or employed in any hazardous employment.” A lot of child labourers get punishment by the government and a fine up to twenty thousand rupees if they get caught. But in India, the practice of child labour still persists in many parts of India. A normal childhood from an individual is snatched away if he is forced into child labour. In every country, there is a right to education for every individual and no one can stop them from getting it. But the poor people do not understand this and think that studying is just a waste of time and money. This thing results in spoiling the future life of their own children. Child Labour in India has become a critical problem now for a very long time and it happens due to certain reasons. India is an underdeveloped country with a lot of unemployment and poverty, this creates a need for the poor people to send their children amongst others to earn and they collect the savings to feed their family and themselves. In India, poor people are so poor that they do not even",
    "have money to eat. The earnings of one person cannot be enough for all of the other family members which is the reason why more earning hands are needed to run the family. Moreover, if there is no adult in the family or the adult is not earning then it automatically becomes the responsibility of the younger person to earn to ensure the survival of the family. All of the burdens falls on the shoulders of the small children and hence they become helpless and vulnerable. Children often go to work in factories and industries which are hazardous for higher wages and this results in poor health and causes diseases. For example, children working in iron mills or factories are more prone to congestion, cough and chills which is caused by the accumulation of iron oxide particles in the lungs when a person breathes in. This inhibits the proper growth of the child and causes diseases. Poor children are grown up facing the fact that they have to earn to feed themselves and run their families on their own. They do not get a chance to live their childhood like other children living a normal childhood. The children of the poor communities and backward classes are often sent to work by parents and taught to earn and live. This has become a serious problem and it needs to be stopped. Children must get proper education and the government should organize campaigns to spread awareness amongst these communities about the importance of education.documentaries based on patriotic themes in order to let the people and children know about various incidents of our freedom struggle",
